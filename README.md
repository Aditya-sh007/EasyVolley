# EasyVolley
Android Volley Wrapper library to make networking easy, flexible and better.

<h2>PURPOSE</h2>
In 2013 google introduced Volley: Easy & Fast Networking library for Android. Since then I fell in love with Volley. It is indeed fast, easy and highly customizable But the approach to integrate it within a project for example, loading images, extending requests, customizing requests etc all seemed quite confusing to me. I always thought of how can we make it easy to use and easy to custimze P.S. also adding some new features would be nice :). This thought became the inspiration behind EasyVolley.
